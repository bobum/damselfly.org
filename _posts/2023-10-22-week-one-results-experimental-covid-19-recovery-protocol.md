Some of you may have read my introduction to why I chose to adopt a new treatment protocol to deal with my lasting effects of a pandemic-related vaccine [**here**](https://www.goldenblogbycasey.com/post/a-path-to-wellness-proven-remedies-diet-guidelines).

I wanted to provide my Week One update on how I responded to treatment so you might also know what to expect.

After implementing the diet and medications, listed at the link above, I experienced the following:

DAY 1

*   Began protocol diet
    
*   Chewed Nicotine Gum (twice) in the afternoon, felt burning in throat and back of my neck, followed by a calming of the pain in my neck and shoulders. Pain reduced by 50% overall, and fever stayed under 99.4 degrees
    
*   Mouth filled with blood upon awaking (this has been happening off and on for the last year, but seems worse this week)
    

DAY 2

*   Applied 3.5 Nicotine Patch and chewed Nicotine gum twice, taking all vitamins listed in protocol
    
*   Saw 80% reduction in overall pain
    
*   Energy increased by 90%, enabling me to walk well over a mile without fatigue (haven't been able to do that this last year)
    
*   Shopped for groceries with no pain, then painted a large canvas or 3 hours before back began to hurt. I took 2 Excedrin's. Despite the exertion pain, felt an overall decrease of pain at about 50% today
    
*   Experienced very loose stool for 24 hours, waste and urine neon yellow in color
    
*   I did not experience the usual mid-day brain fog, but I did feel like I needed a nap
    
*   No fever
    
*   Bloody gums
    

DAY 3

*   Applied 3.5 mg Nicotine Patch, taking all vitamins listed in protocol
    
*   Attempted to chew Nicotine gum, but I was unable to as the burning sensation in my throat and nostrils became to severe for me to tolerate
    
*   Woke up alert (that never happens) with 40-50% less pain than usual, only needing 7 hours of sleep these last two nights (I usually need 8-10 hours to function)
    
*   Nose pimple healed in just last 48 hours. Usually pimples take 2 weeks to heal on my nose when they occur
    
*   A.M. no fever
    
*   P.M. 99.7 degree fever
    
*   As day wore on, pain had decreased 70% from what it normally was throughout my working days, but I did feel tenderness and sensitivity in my hips, legs, feet, knees, shoulders and soft tissues
    
*   Bloody gums
    

DAY 4

*   Applied full-strength 7 mg Nicotine Patch, taking all vitamins listed in protocol, with patch site becoming slightly itchy and red
    
*   I released waste and urine again that was a neon yellow color
    
*   Had A LOT of pain today, and was very sleepy
    
*   Fever 100.1 degrees
    
*   Still had increased energy despite pain and fever
    
*   Bloody gums
    

DAY 5

*   Applied full-strength 7 mg Nicotine Patch, taking all vitamins listed in protocol, with patch site becoming slightly itchy and red
    
*   Second morning in a row that I was very sleepy, with a hard time getting my body going for the day ahead
    
*   Feet and leg pain has been bad for the last 24 hours
    
*   I have noticed a remarkable improvement in my appetite and digestion, feeling true hunger and food tasting better without stomach swelling
    
*   After lunch pain level improved by 70%
    
*   Bloody gums
    
*   Fever 99.6 degrees
    

DAY 6

*   Applied full-strength 7 mg Nicotine Patch, taking all vitamins listed in protocol, with patch site becoming slightly itchy and red
    
*   Intense pain today, triggered after sitting in a bar stool at a restaurant for about 90 minutes. Also, rain was coming and I could feel it
    
*   Bloody gums
    
*   A little hard to wake up this morning, and VERY tired at end of work day
    

DAY 7

*   Applied full-strength 7 mg Nicotine Patch, taking all vitamins listed in protocol, with patch site becoming slightly itchy and red
    
*   Did not sleep well, but pain level decreased from yesterday
    
*   Bloody gums
    

DAY 8

*   Forgot to apply Nicotine Patch, taking all vitamins listed in protocol
    
*   Digestion, appetite and gut health improving with each day ... first week I've genuinely enjoyed food in ages
    
*   Again, didn't sleep well, but pain today lowest it's been yet ... might be lowest pain level in over a year
    
*   Gums NOT bleeding today
    
*   Fever 100.4 degrees
    
*   Felt like if I didn't get a candy bar or ice cream soon, I would crawl outside my own skin to get one ... so I broke down and ate an ice cream
    

DAY 9

*   3.5 mg Nicotine Patch, taking all vitamins listed in protocol
    
*   Hips and shoulders hurting, but felt a touch from Holy Spirit in church this morning, lending some relief
    
*   Gums NOT bleeding today
    
*   Fever 100.6 degrees A.M.
    
*   Skin very itchy today
    

Overall the biggest difference I've noticed this week has been an improvement in my digestion, appetite and energy levels. I've needed much less sleep, but I do get very tired after 4:00 pm and have to take a short break before launching into evening activities, study or chores. Pain and fever has come and gone randomly, so it's hard to track it. Gums were bleeding less after one week of treatment.

Keep following my progress with me. I'm devoting 90 days to cleansing my body, and wearing smaller Nicotine strips daily as prevention, come what may.

I'm also leaning into what healing Jesus Christ has provided for me with His life's sacrifice, continually asking the question: _"Jesus, who do you want to be for me today in the midst of this process?"_ This morning I simply heard Him respond, _"Here."_
