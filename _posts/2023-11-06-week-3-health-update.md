# Week 3 - Health Update 
![ree](/assets/images/blog/3400c2_e93c17d0b0a947eea02b43ce3d543586~mv2.png)

I didn't post last week because I was traveling with my youngest child (far left) for my son & his fiance's (middle) wedding shower festivities two weekends in a row, plus we celebrated my brother's 50th birthday back home.

I've been fairly consistent with the treatment plan, but when I went home these past two weekends I did eat a small amount of foods containing dairy, sugar and refined flour on Saturday and Sunday because I didn't take food with me and that's all that was available.

I have continued my Nicotine patches and supplement regimen, and Monday-Friday's ate very clean with veggies high in Nicotine, Pineapple and Fruits high in Vitamin C.

I continue to run fevers of 100.1 - 100.3 daily. I tire easily by mid afternoon.

I developed a gum infection requiring antibiotics.

After returning home from both weekends I had knots of inflammation in my shoulders, neck, spine and hips. 5 hours of driving each weekend took a toll on me. I've had a lot of feet and leg pain.

I'm itchy all the time, and I've been breaking out in hives for no reason. I awoke Saturday morning at 6 am with hives everywhere my skin was exposed to the air. Underneath my PJ's and socks remained clear of hives. Not sure what could've been in the air to trigger hives.

I'm a bit discouraged. Week One results were so good, and it seems I've regressed a bit. Overall, still 70% better than I was just 3 months ago, so that's something! I thank God or progress.

This week I made my own organic, clean trail mix. I made my own clean candy bars sweetened with dates and honey. I prepped eggplant and zucchini spaghetti with fresh venison, and chopped up pineapple and grapefruit. I boiled potatoes to eat on the run. Now, I just need to buy a mega-blender so I can make my own ice cream. I've yet to find a non-grainy, creamy version of vegan ice cream. But, I'm determined to continue to try various recipes. It seems like most recipes out there use coconut milk or frozen bananas, but those are two flavors I don't really enjoy in my ice cream.

I did make this version of chocolate ice cream once, but I'm out of the Chocolate Ka'Chava Mix. It was so good, and I do remember it being creamy! Recipe is found [**here**](https://www.kachava.com/blogs/recipes-new/avocado-date-ice-cream?nbt=nb%3Aadwords%3Ax%3A19338196530%3A%3A&nb_adtype=&nb_kwd=&nb_ti=&nb_mi=&nb_pc=&nb_pi=&nb_ppi=&nb_placement=&nb_si={sourceid}&nb_li_ms=&nb_lp_ms=&nb_fii=&nb_ap=&nb_mt=&gclid=Cj0KCQiAuqKqBhDxARIsAFZELmKhntKojln4Uz8hpzMNjXzpUHaET9EhyseI6F5LfTo_bTpkuzY5ex4aApccEALw_wcB). It contains avocado, which is soooooo very good for brain health!
