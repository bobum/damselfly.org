Author, Casey, suffering partial facial paralysis while battling Shingles and Covid among Chronic Illness Woes in 2022

I write this in the hopes it might help someone struggling with chronic illness. See bottom of blog for medications and diet guidelines that have helped me the most in recovery...

Marcus Aurelius, a famous stoic, once said something (paraphrased):

_"The obstacle is the way."_ Or, **_"Struggle is the way."_**

I now think differently about that quote.

Many of you know I began having immune system and nervous system issues as early as 1996, but they really did not become life-altering until 2005. Since then I have tried and failed to get answers from countless doctors.

I have, off and on, suffered from migraines, brain fog, allergies, unexplained blistering of eyes and inner ears, hearing loss, vision loss, memory loss, coordination loss, numbness of arms and legs, inability to move legs and arms after exercise, nerve pain in my hands and feet, struggles with digestion and painful menstruation cycles. My body healed slowly, didn't recover from workouts, and felt fatigued after little exertion. When battling something like an infection or virus (such as Shingles or Covid), these symptoms, along with head-to-toe nerve and muscle pain, would put me in bed for days or weeks at the time. At my worst, I was unable to work a full-time job for 7 years. At one point I had to re-teach myself how to spell words. Just writing a sentence was difficult.

After taking some "jabs" in 2022, I became all the more ill.

Me, Casey, doing much better in 2025!

Frustrated with doctors and specialists who kept telling me my symptoms were "all in my head," I began trying anything and everything to find treatments or diets that might help with my symptoms. I found great emotional and mental healing from trauma through [Wellspring Ministries International of Anchorage, Alaska](https://www.akwellspring.com/). However, some my physical symptoms have persisted.

In October of 2023 I began trying to treat the symptoms I was having through healthy diet and upping my intake of nicotine patches and vitamins. While my body responded somewhat well to the diet guidelines listed in [a series of blogs I wrote](https://www.goldenblogbycasey.com/post/returning-to-the-old-ways-a-path-to-health-longevity) in October of that year, I failed to make much improvement otherwise. I suffered badly until the spring of 2024 when I had a dead tooth pulled, and began adding more supplements to my protocol. Apparently that tooth had been dead for years, causing me chronic fevers and inhibiting my already struggling immune system. Shooting in the dark without a definite diagnosis, I also decided to do genetic testing, which has led me to a bevy of new specialists and medications that have helped immensely.

Sadly, I didn't get the attention I needed from specialists until I had the genetic tests in hand, and had married Scott, finally having amazing health insurance. Once I had those, it opened up doors for doctors to take me seriously. I have spent the last 6 months seeing Hematologists, OB/GYN's, Rheumatologists, Endocrinologists, Gastroenterologists, and Holistic Specialists. All of which have treated me so wonderfully! I also see a Chiropractor and a weekly Massage Therapist to help with chronic pain.

So far they have diagnosed me with **Fibromyalgia,****Chronic Fatigue and Brain Fog**. But, genetic and further tests have also shown I have been battling...

*   **Factor-H Deficiency (Mitochondrial Disorder)**, which causes my body to not fight as hard against infections and inflammation _(slow to heal and slow to have muscle recovery after exercise)_.
    
*   **MCAS - Mast Cell Activation Syndrome** _(panic attacks of the auto-immune system)_
    
*   **Histamine Intolerance**_(unidentifiable, random, multiple allergies due to hormonal imbalances)_
    
*   **Dysautonomia/POTS** _(problems regulating heart rate, blood pressure, salt/electrolyte levels, and body temperature leading to swelling)_
    
*   **Adenomyosis** _(extreme inflammation of uterus and bodily tissues)_
    
*   **Fybroid Cysts** _(removed 2025 during partial hysterectomy where uterus proved to be 3x normal size)_
    
*   **Hypertension** _(high blood pressure)_
    
*   **Thyroid Nodules** _(benign)_
    
*   **Fatty Liver Disease**
    
*   **Diverticulosis of Large Intestine AND a very rare type of Diverticulitis of the Small Intestine**
    
*   **Stomach Ulcer & Erosion**
    
*   **Eczema/Psoriasis**
    
*   **Migraines**
    
*   **Post-menopause** _(surprisingly found out I had been in menopause for 10 years, and would not have been able to have children after the age of 35)_
    
*   **Epiploic Appendagitis** _(another rare infection disorder of the intestines)_
    
*   **Cysts on both** **kidneys** _(benign, with one kidney being horizontal)_
    
*   **Gallbladder disease** _(resulting in gallbladder removal 2018)_
    
*   **ADHD** _(99.3% positive on tests)_
    
*   **Thyroid Nodules** _(benign)_
    

I recently tested **positive for ADHD**, a disorder that is often masked by women of my generation UNTIL they hit menopause. As the brain begins to struggle with hormonal abnormalities, ADHD begins to profoundly impact a person's ability to accomplish the tasks that used to be easier. This makes me wonder if I may have been misdiagnosed with "dyslexia" as a child, or if I've always struggled with both?

*   Once I understood I had been in menopause since the age of 35, it made total sense why that was the year my brain all but quit on me. I thought I was struggling with grief, anxiety and depression, but mostly it was me battling all these health issues with no hormones. My brain could only handle so much, it seems.
    
*   One of the biggest struggles I've always had is my brain works faster than my hands, so writing with pen/pencil is very difficult for me.
    
*   I also can associate colors, but cannot remember the correct words and names for things. For example, my husband and I were thinking about going to lunch at Hank's Bar & Grill, but I called it "Huey's." I could remember the color of the restaurant sign, but not the name on it.
    
*   When I study something, especially if there's a test, I have to highlight each page in a different color. So, when I'm taking a test I can remember, "Oh, yeah, that was on the blue page!" or "That was on the orange page!" Otherwise, I'd fail the test miserably.
    
*   My spelling words has always been a struggle.
    
*   My short-term memory is awful, but improving now with treatment.
    
*   I cannot focus on the person in front of me talking if the room is painted in bright colors, or if there's a lot of echo/background noise. This is why I prefer quiet, plain churches as opposed to the chaotic ones with loud music and neon lights. Catholic churches are my favorite places to meditate and pray, even though I'm not Catholic.
    

**In the past the surgeries that helped the most was having two dead teeth pulled.** I battled horrific fevers and chronic infections with rashes on my legs between 2015 - 2024. Doctors were baffled at the cause. But, I had a dental procedure done in 2016 to remove a dead tooth, damaged in a childhood accident. However, the fevers persisted. It was later discovered I had a second dead tooth the dentist had missed, or possibly damaged, during the initial procedures. After they pulled that second tooth in 2024, the fevers and rashes stopped.

The new protocols that have helped me so very much this past year include the following:

**Diet:**

1.  **No No's:** Caffeine, Chocolate, Alcohol, Vinegars, Processed Sandwich Meats and Sodas _(my go-to is Sparkling Waters flavored with lime)_
    
2.  **Cheese:** Part-Skim Cottage Cheese, Organic Cheeses, Ricotta Cheese and Organic Yogurts _(you can make a delicious cheesecake-like snack with Ricotta and a bit of Stevia and Vanilla Flavoring)_
    
3.  **Fats/Oils:** Leaf Lard, Country Crock Olive Oil Butter, Olive Oil, Avocado Oil
    
4.  **Breads:** Dave's Seed Bread or Ezekiel Bread ... or No Carb Wraps _(in moderation)_
    
5.  **Fruits:** Berries, Apples, Bananas, Melons, Pineapple _(no citrus and go easy on peaches/pears)_
    
6.  **Veggies:** Carrots, Roasted Sweet Potatoes, Roasted Potatoes, Celery, Cucumbers, Salad Greens, Avocado _(no nightshade vegetables, such as squash, eggplant, tomatoes or cabbage ... and go easy on onions)_
    
7.  **Nuts and Seeds:** I soak my Chia Seeds 20-30 minutes before digesting and only eat peanuts in moderation because peanuts cause inflammation. I also drink unsweetened Almond Milk more than dairy milk.
    
8.  **Meats:** Eggs, Organic Chicken, Non-Farm Raised Fish, Seafood ... and Grass-Fed Beef _(in moderation)_
    
9.  **Snacks:** I like the veggie snack packs, such as the ones with cheese, nuts and dried cranberries ... or the ones with celery, apples, cheddar, carrots and ranch dip.
    
10.  **Desserts:** I splurge on holidays or when I visit my mom's for a Sunday lunch, but I stay away from processed junk as much as possible. I do eat Benton's 100 calorie chocolate chip snack packs when I have a sweet tooth. Or, I try to make my own, such as peanut butter cups sweetened with honey or maple syrup, and chocolate that's organic if I must. If I go out with my family for ice cream, I get just one scoop with no cone.
    
11.  **Eating Out:** I try to make smart choices, such as getting grilled chicken nuggets at Chick-fil-A with the Kale Salad on the side. Or, I just skip fast food altogether and eat a Kind Nut Bar. Sometimes I'll get a superfood smoothie with vitamins and digestive add-ins at Tropical Smoothie or Smoothie King restaurants.
    

**Meds/Supplements:**

1.  **Cymbalta** - _nerve pain/migraines_
    
2.  **Ka'chave Protein Superfood** Shakes w/ the following add-ins:
    
    1.  **L-Lysine powder** \- _fights viruses_
        
    2.  **Vegan N-Acetyl L-Cysteine powder** - _builds glutathione (detoxifier), supports liver health, immunity strength and respiratory health_
        
    3.  **Chia Seeds** - _helps increase estrogen, fighting perimenopause (not to brag but these seeds taken daily make my breasts look amazing and plump!)_
        
    4.  **ARMRA Colostrum powder** _\- aids in digestion and healthy tissue repair, skin, hair and nails_
        
3.  **Omega-3 Fish Oil Capsules** \- _aids in brain health and cholesterol processing_
    
4.  **Stomach Ulcer Medication & Nexium** - _aids in stomach lining repair and acid reduction_

6.  **Mary Ruth's Prenatal and/or Hair, Skin & Nail Vitamins** _- extra vitamins since my body doesn't always absorb superfood shake vitamins fully_
    
7.  **Atenolol** _- for high blood pressure and rapid-heart rate_
    
8.  **Vitamin C, D3, K2 & Zinc** _\- increase dose during cold/flu season_

If you or someone you love has been suffering from similar issues with no answers, I hope this helps. I'm thankful I had loving and patient parents growing up. It must've been so frustrating to raise a child who was neurodivergent, different and to not have the tools to diagnose and help properly. They really did the best they could.

I still believe in the goodness of God, and in His willingness and ability to **heal "all our diseases."** (Psalms 103:3) In the meantime, I pray we all have the grace to bear suffering well.

Marcus Aurelius, a famous stoic, once said something (paraphrased):

"The obstacle is the way." Or, "Struggle is the way."

I'm not to prideful to say I'd probably still be swimming in my sin had it not been for my intense suffering. Suffering brought me to the feet of Jesus, and I'd rather have an earthly life of suffering with Jesus, than and easy life without Him. (Although, I'll take both Jesus and an easier life should He ever want to gift me with it! LOL)

It's really important we, as Christians, do not slip into the idolatry of wishing we had a happier, easier life. I've noticed in some Evangelical churches they teach God is always 100% willing and able to heal you, and if you're not getting healed, then it must be your fault ... you must be living in some kind of sin. Maybe that's true in some cases, but I believe some people's illnesses are not healed simply because of timing. Although God did not cause the illness, there are times He may be allowing it, for a time, to create godly character in the person who is suffering. Even the great Apostle Paul had to deal with a "thorn in his side," and some great men and women of God have died or lost loved ones inexplicably.

It bothers me that ministers do not teach this generation about how to suffer well. Chip Ingram has an excellent series on his smart phone app, and I think on YouTube, about "suffering well" I highly recommend.

Even Job of the Bible, who lost everything and everyone he loved, save his wife, had a faith crisis and questioned God. But, it wasn't until he saw how small he was, and how great God was, that he realized how far his faith still had to go. Job, albeit a good man and maybe even a blameless man, didn't truly see God for who He was _until_ Job had lost everything and suffered much.

I know healing is available for all of us, and it will come, either on this side of Heaven or the next. Stand with me as we, together, believe for God's will to be done in our daily lives here on earth as it is in Heaven.

Let's live one-day-at-a-time and try not to think of all the years and lost opportunities seemingly wasted in illness. **For we serve a God who restores "the YEARS the locusts, caterpillar and canker-worms have eaten!"** {Joel 2:25)
