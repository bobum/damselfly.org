# You've Ruined Me
![ree](/assets/images/blog/37d5d08a03074b9a91969aa16741a088.jpg)

I used to live in Nashville, and I have had many singer-songwriter friends over the years. My bother is a professional musician. I could never boast any of their talent, but once in a while I'll hear a whole new song in my head. Usually they're coming of age tales of lessons learned. As someone who has survived a narcissistic relationship, and has suffered many setbacks, my songs always sound a bit country in my head.

This was one of them:

**Round this mountain I go, yet again**

**Wondering if it's because of my deep sin**

**Mama told me better, daddy did, too**

**Got a sinking feeling they were talkin' bout you**

**Round this peak a few dozen times**

**How did I miss all those signs?**

**Should've walked away, should've run very far**

**Now all I'm good for is singing in this bar**

**You ruined me**

**I can't stand the thought of a man**

**You ruined me**

**Now all I can do is front this band**

**You opened my doors**

**Paid for all my meals**

**Took me round the world**

**Gave me all the feels**

**Planted dreams of mini you and me's**

**Now I walk away with arms empty**

**You told everyone in town it was all my fault**

**When really I had you, you'd been caught**

**You ruined me**

**I can't stand the thought of a man**

**You ruined me**

**Now all I can do is front this band**

**You took me round the world**

**Filled my head with dreams**

**I was happier then**

**Anyone could see**

**You opened all my doors**

**Gave me all the feels**

**You'd be dead if singing this song could kill**

**Here's hoping melody mends and heals**

**Round this mountain I go**
