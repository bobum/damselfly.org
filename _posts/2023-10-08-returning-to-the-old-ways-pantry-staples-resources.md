I think a good place to start living in the "Blue Zone" of life is a cookbook that helps you get jump started into the clean-eating lifestyle. Loving ourselves and those we cook for is a huge part of my walk, although I don't have many people to cook for lately. My only roommate, my ultra picky teenage daughter, isn't a huge fan of the Pescatarian/Mediterranean-inspired diet I've chosen to adopt. But, she does love a good Korean or Asian inspired meal, and the **"**[**Eat Your Heart Out**](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=eat+your+heart+out+daphne+oz&i=stripbooks&crid=3W0GD18O7LBWI&sprefix=eat+your+heart+out%2Cstripbooks%2C76&ref=nb_sb_ss_fb_1_18)**"** cookbook by Daphne Oz has plenty of those recipes.

I've tried many cookbooks geared towards veganism and fighting inflammation/allergies, from Alicia Silverstone's **"**[**The Kind Diet**](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=the+kind+diet+alicia+silverstone&i=stripbooks&crid=22CW3U8FADKO6&sprefix=the+kind+diet%2Cstripbooks%2C94&ref=nb_sb_ss_fb_2_13)**"** to Erin McKenna's **"**[**Babycakes**](https://www.amazon.com/BabyCakes-Gluten-Free-Sugar-Free-Recipes-Talked-About/dp/0307408833/ref=asc_df_0307408833/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=312142549358&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=16904338759907638032&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9011447&hvtargid=pla-494534614758&psc=1)**."** The only things in The Kind Diet that really spoke to me were the peanut butter cups and brown rice treats. Her savory meals were not my favorite, but to be fair, it was written over 15-years ago and the options are better now.

Babycakes has fantastic gluten-free, dairy-free bakery recipes. For example, the cornbread is a must. But, it's hard to make some of her recipes because they require having a lot of ingredients on hand that go bad quickly. Gluten free foods also don't have a long shelf life. So, it's best to make small batches and wait to cook those favorite recipes when there's going to be some other people around to help you eat it. There are also many gluten-free bread mixes and cake mixes now available on grocery store shelves. I will give a shout-out to her icing recipe in the cookbook. I really love her icing and flavor combos.

From the first time I saw Daphne Oz on The Food Network television show, Chopped, I thought she was the most beautiful, vibrant, healthy woman I'd ever laid my eyes on. She has the healthiest skin, hair and nails, with very clear, bright eyes. She looks like she's wearing a camera filter, but she's not. She's just that dang pretty. I instantly thought, "I'll have what she's having!"

Daphne's _Eat Your Heart Out_ cookbook is the best book I've found on the kind of diet talked about in the Netflix documentary, "Live to 100: Secret of the Blue Zones." You can read more about that subject matter in my [**previous blog**](https://www.goldenblogbycasey.com/post/returning-to-the-old-ways-a-path-to-health-longevity).The recipes are delicious, and most can be served to young children. Daphne has four, if I'm not mistaken.

To get started towards cooking her recipes, and living a more clean centenarian lifestyle, you have to throw out all white flour, white sugar and processed foods from your pantry, fridge and freezer. Next, you'll want to begin stocking your pantry with the following items. I admit, as a cash-strapped single mom, it will be quite a while before I can have a pantry stocked like this, but I've been starting small and will build as I go...
