Are you already craving pumpkin-spice-everything, but you live in the south where it will be sweltering hot until Thanksgiving? This recipe is for you! It's cool, refreshing, and you can even substitute the Whipped Topping for the Fat-Free or Sugar-Free versions of Whipped Topping to make it a tad bit healthier.

I don't remember where I found this recipe years ago, but it hits the spot every time.

**No Bake Pumpkin Pie Recipe:**

*   1 bag (10 oz) **Marshmallows**
    
*   1 cup (small can) pure **Pumpkin Puree**
    
*   1 tsp **Cinnamon**
    
*   1/2 teaspoon **Pumpkin Pie Spice** _(I didn't have any this time, so I used_ **_Allspice_**_)_
    
*   1/2 teaspoon **Salt**
    
*   1 carton (8 oz) **Whipped Topping** (thawed) _(I used Great Value brand from WalMart)_
    
*   _If you want additional whipped topping on the top of your pie, purchase a second carton and thaw in fridge until ready to serve_
    
*   1 deep-dish store-bought **Pie Crust** (gluten free, graham cracker or frozen ... if you can't find deep-dish, use two regular crusts)
    
*   **_Optional:_** 1/2 cup **Speculoos Cookie Butter**
    

**Directions:**

If you purchased a frozen pie crust, bake according to package directions and cool to room temperature. Over low-medium heat in a non-stick pot, warm marshmallows, pumpkin, spices and salt together until melted and well blended. Cool to room temperature. Once cooled, stir in thawed whipped topping and pour into pie crust. Place a layer of plastic food wrap over pie and refrigerate no less than 4 hours. When ready to serve, top with an additional layer of whipped topping if desired.

**Fun Twist with Cookie Butter:**

If you have any Cookie Butter laying around, melt a bit and drizzle on top for an extra punch of fall flavor. Or, when you're cooking the marshmallows and pumpkin together, add 1/2 cup Cookie Butter to the mixture. It really ramps up the flavor profile!

Enjoy!
