I have committed to writing at least 52 blogs in 52 weeks, starting Thanksgiving week of 2022.

I was inspired by Julie Powell's story. She famously cooked her way through Julia Child's 524 recipes in 365 days, blogging about it along the way in 2002. A movie was released about her experience in 2009. Julie sadly lost her life at the young age of 49 just last month, prompting me to re-watch the film, **_Julie & Julia_**, last week.

_(Odd side note: Margaret Mitchell, famous author of Gone With The Wind, which was released on my birthday, also died tragically at age 49 when she was struck by a car in Atlanta)_

As a wannabe writer, I was so touched by Julie's story because I know what kind of exhaustion and dedication it takes to write 365 blogs in 365 days. I cannot imagine working a full-time job and cooking each night on top of that!

And, I was touched by the story of Julia Child, who devoted years of her life to writing quite possibly the most comprehensive cookbook series ever written.

These two ladies, having grown up in very different generations, had challenging marriages and disappointments. Julie and her husband cheated on each other, but recommitted and wrote a book about their ups and downs. Julia and her husband, although madly in love, were never able to have children.

Julie cussed like a sailor, and Julia was the embodiment of a true lady. Julie struggled financially and lived in a tiny apartment in Queens. Julia came from wealth and privilege. Very different women, with their own diverse stories. Their lives made for one great movie.

My first blog challenge is to write about fall. It is my favorite season, but as I think about it, I find myself reflecting on all of the wonderful women in history who have left us with the complexities of their stories to learn from. And, this Thanksgiving holiday week, I'm just so darn thankful for these ladies who led such brave lives.

Margaret Mitchell is the embodiment of what it means to learn to adapt to life's changing circumstances, or die. She both wrote about and lived the importance of a woman's ability to adapt and change directions as quickly as a dragonfly changes it's charge. We see this lived out through the character of Scarlette O'hara.

These ladies impress me so much more than the cascade of warm hued leaves, firepits, s'mores or even the crisp, cool air.

This fall makes me think of all of the women in my own life who haven't had it fair or easy, but who courageously forge their way forward to make their dreams, and the dreams of their children, a reality. These women adapt and survive, and go on to thrive in spite of what life has thrown at them. These women are you and I.

What is the clich saying?

**_Here's to strong women. May we know them. May we be them. May we raise them._**
