I have been wondering how to reconnect with God, after a season of feeling distant and not as connected as I used to be. I've already planned a Daniel Fast for January to help facilitate the process. I love what Pricilla shares in this video, but I also think everything spoken in this video by these various speakers is so packed with truth. Very timely that my mom sent me this video.
