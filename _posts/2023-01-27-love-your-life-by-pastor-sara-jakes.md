I was sitting at a women's conference at the Sun Dome in Tampa, FL in March of 2005 when T.D. Jakes preached a message. I don't recall the message, albeit life altering. His messages always are. He's been dubbed the G.O.A.T. among American preachers.

It was during an incredibly hard season (1999 - 2005), as a baby Christian, and in the aftermath of my first failing marriage, that T.D. Jakes' messages kept me from wilting onto the floor. They never failed to give me what I needed, at that time, to keep going.

I do remember that night in Tampa God spoke to me for the first time in four years and told me to go back to college to be a writer. My obedience to do so quite literally saved my life some years later. That's a story for another day.

Yet, writing is still saving my life. It is the only thing I do that ... when I do it ... I don't feel like I should be doing something else. It picks me up when I'm down. It helps me process difficult emotions. It helps me to lay down my emotions on pain and walk away reminded of God's truth and purpose for my life.

So, it's no surprise that Pastor Sara Jakes, who has such an incredible testimony of how God saved her from rock-bottom, can preach every bit as good as her daddy. When I heard this message recently, I knew I had to share it with all of you.
