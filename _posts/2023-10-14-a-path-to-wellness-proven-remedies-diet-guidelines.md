# A Path To Wellness -- Proven Remedies & Diet Guidelines
![ree](/assets/images/blog/3400c2_0eb32e9c7847455cab3cae9554e6b113~mv2.png)

There are many opinions about the origins of the Covid-19 virus, our government and the ingredients housed in the various vaccines available. I won't speak to those because my website would be taken down. **I am not anti-vaccine, as long as they have been tried, tested and proven.** However, I will encourage you to educate yourself about how to keep yourself and your family healthy, and share my personal experience.

I was told, at the age of 43, I had to take two different types of vaccines in order to work at a medical facility in July 2022. My primary care physician wrote me an exemption letter based on my past health history of being highly sensitive to vaccines and medications. My employer ignored this request and told me I had to take the vaccines if I wanted to work there. As a single mom, I felt I had to take the vaccines in order to provide for me and my one minor child still living at home. I took the vaccines against my doctor's advice. I suffered the following symptoms over the next 12 months ...

*   Diagnosed with Flu twice, even though I'd never had the flu in 43 years of life
    
*   Developed a chronic cough that lasted for 12 months
    
*   I lost control of my bladder for 5 months
    
*   I had trouble breathing for 9 months
    
*   I had Shingled FIVE times
    
*   Sores in my mouth & a chronic sore throat
    
*   I had daily migraines and fevers that reach 100+ degrees every day
    
*   Numbness in neck, shoulders, arms and hands
    
*   I developed an inability to digest most foods, filling the toilet up with blood frequently from intestinal issues
    
*   I developed allergies I didn't have before
    
*   I developed psoriasis and an itchy, burning scalp
    
*   I hurt all over like I have the flu 24/7
    
*   My spine burned from my neck down to my tailbone
    
*   I had Bartholin cysts that developed immediately after taking the stick, and they would not respond to antibiotics or steroids. After several months of suffering mercilessly with blood and puss filling my feminine pads several times a day, every day, my OB/GYN removed the infection surgically in December 2022. I almost had septic shock twice from these cyst infections, shaking uncontrollably for hours as my fevers spiked as high as 104.5 degrees. They continued to return, with the most recent struggle in Sept. 2023
    
*   In June 2023 I began having ringing in my ears, a burning sensation on back of neck and base of skull, and experienced an 18-hour fainting episode that landed me in the ER. The ER doctor believed I was experiencing Dysautonomia/POTS symptoms as a result of the stick. Another local specialist said my symptoms went way beyond what Dysautonomia/POTS causes, and suspected I had simply had a sensitive autoimmune system that was greatly aggravated by the vaccines
    
*   The worst part was the brain fog. I can tolerate a lot physically as long as my brain is working. I was so sick, my brain just shut down for most of that year. I struggled at home and at work. Some days just reading emails was more than I could handle. I sadly admit, there were times when I was so depressed due to the symptoms I almost lost my will to live

Despite these symptoms, I only missed two days of work not allotted to me as "sick days." I didn't want to be one of those people who ever filed for disability because I was trying to build a life and career that would support my daughter's desire to attend SCAD in Atlanta in 2026. I also wanted to be a blessing to my employer and my new community. We had moved to a new city, away from all of our family, the same month I took the first stick. My daughter had an opportunity to attend a performing arts high school, and I would've done anything to make that happen for her. Anyway, after 11 months of suffering, my employer let me go for "poor performance." I felt like I was being punished for taking the sticks they required I take in order to be employed there. They did not have a contingency plan in place, apparently, for employees who had injuries like mine. So, they just threw this single mom and her kid to the wolves.

Anyhue, for my own peace of mind, I've forgiven the person who made that decision. I'm sure it couldn't have been easy to choose between me and the betterment of the organization and the patients they served as a whole. The whole of my focus this past summer was on my health, seeking God's answers for my situation, and focusing on what I could do to improve my situation.

One of the things I've done is surround myself with Christian healers who rely more on faith than medicines. I will say, however, they're not so "out there" that they reject medicine. I have received a great measure of healing from God since July 2023 through prayer, and I feel God guiding me towards using foods and what nature has provided to complete the healing process. Now, my body is only suffering from...

*   Low-grade daily fevers
    
*   Daily headaches and body aches, although not nearly as bad as they were
    
*   One cyst infection recently
    
*   Neck, shoulder weakness, pain and occasional numbness
    
*   Psoriasis in scalp and hands, but it is much improved
    
*   Food allergies

I have learned never to ask God **"Why did this happen to me?"** He almost never answers that question, mainly because I think He knows the answer wouldn't satisfy us anyway. Instead, I ask, **"What can I learn from this situation?"** and **"Father God, who do you want to be for me in this situation?"** I have found when I approach God this way, it keeps me on a path of unhindered fellowship with Him as my Father, and it helps keep me out of self-pity.

To understand what God has shown me this past summer, start with [**Post #1**](https://www.goldenblogbycasey.com/post/returning-to-the-old-ways-a-path-to-health-longevity) and [**Post #2**](https://www.goldenblogbycasey.com/post/returning-to-the-old-ways-pantry-staples-resources)

I'll summarize part of the treatment plan I've adopted from that video and my research below, but I greatly encourage you to watch the video for yourself, especially the end.

**My current protocol to treat my remaining symptoms:**

*   7 mg Nicotine patches for 7 days (can half these patches to begin with if they feel too strong for you). After first 7 days, take 14 mg patches and cut them into 6 strips. Wear one of the smaller strips daily for no less than 7-14 days. The doctors from the video suggest wearing these small patches indefinitely as a preventative measure to protect against future pandemic type infections. You can also chew Nicotine gum four times a day for relief of the loss of taste/smell and other Long-Covid symptoms
    
*   Daily doses of Vitamin C, Vitamin D, Zinc and Melatonin
    
*   I noticed I got my brain and focus back after I started taking Fish Oils rich in Omega-3's, Bodega, and CQ-10 (which supports heart health)
    
*   For severe virus sufferers, take Corticosteroids and N-acetyl-cysteine
    
*   STOP taking Magnesium for 90 days, avoiding chocolate and other foods that contain large doses of Magnesium, as Magnesium helps the negative virus and vaccine ingredients adhere to and enter your body's cells
    
*   Eat a diet high in Nicotine saturated foods, such as Eggplants, Tomatoes, Squash, Zucchini, and other "nightshade" vegetables. Also, increase your intake of Grapefruit, Lemons, Tangerines and Pineapple (the Bromelain in Pineapple is the active ingredient you need, and can also be purchased as a supplement)
    
*   Temporarily, please consider a [**Pescatarian Diet**](https://www.google.com/search?q=Pescatarian+Diet+Food+List&sca_esv=573522448&sxsrf=AM9HkKnLuwsBgJZ9-K0-Q0Tue21UyQ0cyw%3A1697331833501&source=hp&ei=eTorZY-kHM65qtsP4p6B4AE&iflsig=AO6bgOgAAAAAZStIiZ3fJVIjjGwINgJmIMjKfor7YUO_&ved=0ahUKEwjPxP_n7faBAxXOnGoFHWJPABwQ4dUDCAw&uact=5&oq=Pescatarian+Diet+Food+List&gs_lp=Egdnd3Mtd2l6IhpQZXNjYXRhcmlhbiBEaWV0IEZvb2QgTGlzdDIIEAAYigUYkQIyBhAAGBYYHjIGEAAYFhgeMgYQABgWGB4yBhAAGBYYHjIGEAAYFhgeMgYQABgWGB4yBhAAGBYYHjIGEAAYFhgeMgYQABgWGB5I3BZQxwxYxwxwAXgAkAEAmAFLoAFLqgEBMbgBA8gBAPgBAvgBAagCCsICBxAjGOoCGCc&sclient=gws-wiz&bshm=rimc/1#ip=1) or a [**Mediterranean Diet**](https://thrivemarket.com/blog/mediterranean-diet-food-list?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=Non-Brand_SEM_Broad_Broad_DSA&utm_content=56904184540&utm_term=655504648470-dsa-19959388920&device=c&gclid=CjwKCAjw-KipBhBtEiwAWjgwrKkk03nasp8CpiTjEj1riNh7z0iH2OyRhaBF3nfiMeuguSc76fJ6EBoC7wsQAvD_BwE) rich in the foods and ingredients described [**HERE**](https://www.goldenblogbycasey.com/post/returning-to-the-old-ways-pantry-staples-resources).
    
*   Temporarily, avoid red meat, pork, un-organic chicken, farm-raised fish, dairy and sugar

One of my best friends is an expert on holistic health remedies, and she is the one who has also told me to employ [**Pine Needle Tea**](https://www.thehungrybites.com/pine-needle-tea/) to detox my body from toxins, and [**Sound Frequency Therapy, such as this center in Dothan, Alabama**](https://www.unifydhealing.com/centers/emerging-spaces). Sound Frequency centers can be found around the country by visiting the [UnifydHealing.com](http://unifydhealing.com/) website. I've yet to try these two remedies, but they are on my list! The research is compelling.

I'm just kicking myself because it took me so long to give these things a try. I was in such a state of survival-mode last year, I could barely function. Now that I have my brain back, I will post my progress on this blog so those who may be suffering from vaccine injuries, autoimmune issues or long-haul symptoms may also get some much needed relief. Follow my blog so you can stay updated on what's working for me, and what doesn't.
